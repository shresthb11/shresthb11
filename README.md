## Hi there, I'm [shresth bhargava]! 👋
I'm a second-year Computer Science student and an aspiring software developer. I'm passionate about building efficient backend systems and scalable web applications. I love tackling complex problems and learning new things every day. 🧑‍💻

🎓 I’m currently studying at [VIT Bhopal University].

🌱 I’m currently exploring high-performance computing with Rust and C++.

💡 I'm looking for internship opportunities where I can contribute and grow as a developer.

🛠️ My Tech Stack
I enjoy working with a variety of tools and technologies. Here are some of my favorites:

Languages
🐍 Python: My primary language for web development, scripting, and building APIs.

⚙️ C++: Used for performance-critical projects and strengthening my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

🦀 Rust: My new favorite for its focus on safety, concurrency, and blazing-fast performance.

Frameworks & Libraries
🚀 Django: For building robust, full-featured, and secure web applications.

🌐 Flask: My choice for lightweight microservices and quick projects.

⚡ FastAPI: For creating modern, high-performance APIs with automatic documentation.

💡 What I'm Working On
I believe in learning by doing. Here are some of the things I'm focused on right now:

Building a RESTful API using FastAPI to serve data for a mobile app concept.

Developing a small command-line tool in Rust to better understand memory management and ownership.

Contributing to an open-source project written in C++ to gain experience with larger codebases.
